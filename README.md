Welcome to the **Tool Tracker** â€“ a simple tool tracking system designed to help our team keep a record of all tools, who is currently holding them, where they're stored, and what they're being used for.

The main goal of this project is to:
- Maintain a centralized log of all tools.

This system helps improve accountability, reduce loss, and make tool sharing more efficient across the team.

## âœ… Features

- Add a new tool with its details.
- Assign tools to team members.
- Track current holder and location.
- Log purpose or usage of each tool.
- Easily update status when tools are returned or reassigned.
